Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said "Quack quack quack quack"
But only four little ducks came back

Four little ducks went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said "Quack quack quack quack"
But only three little ducks came back

Three little ducks went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said "Quack quack quack quack"
But only two little ducks came back

Two little ducks went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said "Quack quack quack quack!"
But only one little ducks came back

One little duck went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said "Quack quack quack quack!"
But none of the five little ducks came back

Well, sad mother duck went out one day
Over the hills and far away
Mother duck said "Quack quack quack QUACK!"
And all of the five little duckies came back
